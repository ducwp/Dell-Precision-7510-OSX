# Dell-Precision-7510-OSX
Tutorial for a working Mac OS Mojave (10.14.x) environment on the Dell Precision (7510). 

I can claim none (zero, zilch, nada) of what is in this repo as my own work. 

Sources are those usual hackintosh sites so credit goes to where credit is due.

Some of the machine specs are as follows:

4k Diaplay

Xeon E3-1505M V5 (Onboard Intel HD Graphics P530)

64GB ECC RAM

Samsung 950 Pro NVMe SSD

Samsung 850 Pro 2TB SSD

Nvidia Quadro M1000M w/2GB GDDR5 

Dell DW1560 (BCM4352) - Replacing stock Intel Wireless 8260

Bios Version is latest at the time (1.17.7)
