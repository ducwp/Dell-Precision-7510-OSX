# Dell-Precision-7510-OSX
Tutorial for a working Mac OS Mojave (10.14.x) environment on the Dell Precision (7510). 

I can claim none (zero, zilch, nada) of what is in this repo as my own work. 

Sources are those usual hackintosh sites so credit goes to where credit is due.

Some of the machine specs are as follows:

Xeon E3-1505M V5 (Onboard Intel HD Graphics P530)
64GB ECC RAM
Samsung 950 NVMe SSD
Samsung 850 2TB SSD
NVidia M1000M
Dell DW1560 (BCM4352) - Replacing stock Intel Wireless 8260

Bios Version is latest at the time (1.17.7)
